  /// A clock whose time can be controlled in a deterministic manner.
  ///
  /// This clock is useful for testing how the flow of time affects asynchronous and concurrent code.
  /// This includes any code that makes use of `sleep` or any time-based async operators, such as
  /// timers, `debounce`, `throttle`, `timeout`, and more.
  ///
  /// For example, suppose you have a model that encapsulates the behavior of a timer that can be
  /// started and stopped:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @MainActor
  /// class FeatureModel: ObservableObject {
  ///   @Published var count = 0
  ///   let clock: any Clock<Duration>
  ///   var timerTask: Task<Void, Error>?
  ///
  ///   init(clock: any Clock<Duration>) {
  ///     self.clock = clock
  ///   }
  ///   func startTimerButtonTapped() {
  ///     self.timerTask = Task {
  ///       while true {
  ///         try await self.clock.sleep(for: .seconds(5))
  ///         self.count += 1
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///   }
  ///   func stopTimerButtonTapped() {
  ///     self.timerTask?.cancel()
  ///     self.timerTask = nil
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Here we have explicitly forced a clock to be provided in order to construct the `FeatureModel`.
  /// This makes it possible to use a real life clock, such as `ContinuousClock`, when running on a
  /// device or simulator, and use a more controllable clock in tests, such as the ``TestClock``.
  ///
  /// To write a test for this feature we can construct a `FeatureModel` with a ``TestClock``, then
  /// advance the clock forward and assert on how the model changes:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// func testTimer() async {
  ///   let clock = TestClock()
  ///   let model = FeatureModel(clock: clock)
  ///
  ///   XCTAssertEqual(model.count, 0)
  ///   model.startTimerButtonTapped()
  ///
  ///   await clock.advance(by: .seconds(1))
  ///   XCTAssertEqual(model.count, 1)
  ///
  ///   await clock.advance(by: .seconds(4))
  ///   XCTAssertEqual(model.count, 5)
  ///
  ///   model.stopTimerButtonTapped()
  ///   await clock.run()
  /// }
  /// ```
